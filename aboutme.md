My name is Justin Turney. I'm a self taught programmer in the following languages, ranked by proficiency:

- Python
- HTML/CSS (Do those count?)
- Javascript
- Java
- Rust

What else do you need?

### My story

I taught myself to program in order to automate boring tasks in my IT job and now I can't stop.
